                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Greetings! I am Ray Gottsch and I am a Software Engineer currently sharpening his skills to take on the wide world of programming! I am based out of the lovely Oregon!</p>
                <p>I graduated from Western Oregon University in 2018 and have been practicing Software Development, as well as general IT skills, ever since!</p>
                <p>My current project is studying to become a Full-Stack Engineer. With the help of my degree and Codecademy, I am working hard to deepen my skill set for later projects.</p>
                <p>In my free time I am an avid gamer and nerd! I run a Dungeons and Dragons game for some friends and write a ton of content for them.</p>
                <p>If you would like to contact me for any professional inquiries please drop me a line through my contacts page.</p>
